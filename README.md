Recruitment task.
Code is ugly, made with "forget architecture, forget frameworks, just get it and print it!" aproach, which is shame on me, however it meet requirements.

Just build it with Maven, and run passing football name club as argument.
Example run command:
mvn exec:java -D"exec.mainClass"="info.football.Main" -Dexec.args="odlew"
